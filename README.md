# Project Documentation
## Week 1
  
Styles
Defines styles for various elements on the page, including text field dimensions and graphical output.

 HTML Expression Input Form
Contains a form with an input field for mathematical expressions, a button for graph plotting, and a designated block for displaying the graph.

 Scripts Section
- Includes three scripts added to the page:
  1. Expression Parsing Script
    - Loads a library for parsing mathematical expressions.
  2. math.js Library Script
    - Loads the math.js library for computational tasks.
  3. Plotly Library Script
    - Loads the Plotly library for graph plotting.


 JavaScript Functions
These functions perform specific tasks:

- addToExpression(value)
  - Adds a value to the expression in the input field.
- clearExpression()
  - Clears the input field for expressions.
- plotGraph()
  - Plots the graph of the mathematical expression using the Plotly library and performs computations with the math.js library.
