### Getting Started
Press the project start button labeled "http" or in the "PowerShell for Developers" console, execute the command "dotnet run".
### Project Documentation
- Week 1
  
Styles
Defines styles for various elements on the page, including text field dimensions and graphical output.

 HTML Expression Input Form
Contains a form with an input field for mathematical expressions, a button for graph plotting, and a designated block for displaying the graph.

 Scripts Section
- Includes three scripts added to the page:
  1. Expression Parsing Script
    - Loads a library for parsing mathematical expressions.
  2. math.js Library Script
    - Loads the math.js library for computational tasks.
  3. Plotly Library Script
    - Loads the Plotly library for graph plotting.


 JavaScript Functions
These functions perform specific tasks:

- addToExpression(value)
  - Adds a value to the expression in the input field.
- clearExpression()
  - Clears the input field for expressions.
- plotGraph()
  - Plots the graph of the mathematical expression using the Plotly library and performs computations with the math.js library.
  
- Week 2
 - Calculator
   
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Power and Root Functions: Calculate the power of a number and find its square root.
Percentage Calculation: Determine the percentage of a number.
Trigonometric Functions: Compute sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle.
Logarithmic Function: Calculate the logarithm of a number.

 - Graph Plotting
   
Math Expression Plot: Enter a mathematical expression, and the tool plots the corresponding graph.
Customizable Graphs: Supports expressions with variables like 'x' and 'y'.
Visualization Range: Graphs are displayed within a specified range on both the X and Y axes.
   
 - Interface
   
User-Friendly Input: Enter mathematical expressions easily through a dedicated input field.
Keypad for Convenience: Use a keypad with numerical keys and function keys for efficient input.
Responsive Design: The application is designed for usability on various devices.

 - Usage
   
Calculator Mode: Select the calculator tab, enter an expression, and press the '=' button to calculate the result. The answer is displayed below the input field.
Graph Plotting Mode: Switch to the graph plotting tab, enter a math expression with 'x' or 'y', and click the "Plot Graph" button. The graph will be displayed in the designated area.

 - Notes
   
The calculator uses the math.js library for mathematical evaluations.
