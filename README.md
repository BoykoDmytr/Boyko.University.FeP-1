## Getting Started
- Implement feature: Graph Plotter ✔
## Project Documentation
Styles
Defines styles for various elements on the page, including text field dimensions and graphical output.

HTML Expression Input Form
Contains a form with an input field for mathematical expressions, a button for graph plotting, and a designated block for displaying the graph.

Scripts Section
Includes three scripts added to the page:

Expression Parsing Script

Loads a library for parsing mathematical expressions.
math.js Library Script

Loads the math.js library for computational tasks.
Plotly Library Script

Loads the Plotly library for graph plotting.
JavaScript Functions
These functions perform specific tasks:

addToExpression(value)

Adds a value to the expression in the input field.
clearExpression()

Clears the input field for expressions.
plotGraph()

Plots the graph of the mathematical expression using the Plotly library and performs computations with the math.js library.
